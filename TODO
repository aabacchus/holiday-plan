actually match waterfalls to hostels
plot everything on one map, colour coded
(note: mapbox sets the width automatically from my height and bbox)

hostels.xml is only England and Wales (YHA);
and Scottish waterfalls are ignored by the scraper.

Make a webpage with interactive maps, and photos of each waterfall?
